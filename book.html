         You stood on my back confused not knowing where to go even i was in the same state of confusion. I was in urge to talk to you somehow but I couldn't and I told myself anjii dont let her slide away.
         
       You looked soo beautiful. I would re-live that day a million times. I would put your tea in the waste basket a million times..</p>

          <p>
            It’s incredible to think how, a year before , I didn’t even know you. I wanted to connect with you, I searched ways to talk to you. and then we started sharing reels. I still remember..

            The first reel I sent you was that 20 feet anaconda hunting guy's.. You matched the vibe and from then.. we started texting and laughing and opening up.. I looved it. 

You’re absolutely amazing. 💖

Your words, your kindness, and the way you make me smile have already made a place in my heart. I never expected to meet someone like you, but now, I can’t imagine not having you in my life.

Maybe it was destiny, or maybe it was just luck—but whatever it was, I’m glad it brought me to you. 💕
